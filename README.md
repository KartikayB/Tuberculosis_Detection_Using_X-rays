# Tuberculosis_Detection_Using_X-rays

## Problem definition/Aim   

Using Chest X-Rays and/or CT Scans, we can detect the abnormalities that might have developed and are expected to lead to TB/Covid-19.    

In this project, we are focusing on Tuberculosis with the aim to not only reduce the workload on the medical facilities during the current scenario of Covid-19 but also, by using this early diagnosis technique prevent a confusion between a suspected Covid-19 and a suspected Tuberculosis patient.   

## Possible approaches/methods   
      :star: Classification using VGG-16
      :star: Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
      :star2: Classification using fast-ai deployment with resnet-50[1] Model

> For this project, we have used the resnet-50[1] Model

## Results Achieved and Conclusion   

We have achieved an accuracy of 86.7% on our dataset. The accuracy was achieved at 5 epochs . And then a decrease in the accuracy was observed with loss not favorably decreasing.
